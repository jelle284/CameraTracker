# CameraTracker
This is a part of a DIY VR project consisting of hmd + controllers with 6 DOF tracking. This is a windows application to communicate with the sensors and setting up the tracking.

TODO:

  -> Try with LibUSB instead of CodeLabs drivers (see psmove service).
  
  -> Implement unscented kalman filter (https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3085/aa4779c04898685c1b2d50cdafa98b132d3f.pdf)
 

Requires OpenCV 2.4.13.6 and CLEye drivers. Note CLEye only supports 32 bit.
